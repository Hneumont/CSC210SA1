        <h4>Education:</h4>
        <p>I am currently attending Neumont College of Computer Science to gain a degree in CS.
            <br>My entire education has been based in Utah, from elementary up to college.</p>
        <h4>Achievements:</h4>
        <p>While I was in highschool I took a course for Game development, this course taught me almost nothing,<br>
            but I did achieve a certification from said course.<br><br>
            Additionally, the profesors who taught the course showed me an opportunity to partake in a state contest.<br>
            This contest would be held by SkillsUSA and was essentially a Game Jam, I would go on to place 2nd, losing 1st to a dress code.</p>
        <h4>Other notes:</h4>
        <p>Occasionally I'll see a moment in time and take a photo of it, I am by no means a photographer but I think they end up looking neat.<br><br>
            I am striving to be an indie game developer, I find the proccess of making, designing, playtesting, and devloping games to be really fun,<br>
            but I don't want to go into game development as a career. The industry is and will forever be horrible, and I think my time is better spent<br>
            doing something that won't burn me out every 2 days- <br>it also gives me more time to focus on my own games, rather than a game I am tasked to make.</p>
