    About Me/Contact Page:
    list any information you'd like to share about yourself and how to contact you.
    Be careful what you share here since we will be deploying these. And you can update it with real data later when you're ready to use the site more if you want.
    (optional) Resume (I know it's a bit early to be thinking about your resume, but you could include it in your personal profile.)
