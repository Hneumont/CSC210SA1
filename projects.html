        <h4>Gamedev/Godot:</h4>
        <p>I have started over 50 personal projects all involving some form of game development.<br>
            none of these projects have yet to be finished, many of them were outright deleted<br>
            I have chosen to relegate my time to making tools for projects, as I have found that the majority<br>
            of the time it takes to make a game related project is spent making things that are similar to other projects<br>
            by making simplified tools, I can then make projects that combine some of those tools while having their own unique elements.<br><br>
            Currently, I am working on a weapon system, one that is both complex, yet simple, modular, yet unrestrictive.
